Appending - In general, innerHTML is slower than appendChild(), 
because with innerHTML, the browser need to parse the input string, 
create objects for elements/text, then add them into the DOM.

In simple one-time cases, createElement/appendChild is more efficient,
but in cases where many changes are made, innerHTML can be the more efficient
choice
to bypass recalculating, painting and layout for every single element we added
var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
